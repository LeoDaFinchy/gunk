This is my new project. The goal: to iteratively create a game in such a way that each iteration is playable, and includes at least one new feature.

"Iteratively"
-
I'm not going to start out with some grand plan. I have ideas buzzing around, but the point of this project is to explore the space of possible games, going for easy next steps rather than stretching towards some ideal.

"Game"
-
Definitions abound, but I'll make do with this: an iteractive system that responds to user input in order to virtually explore a possibility space.

"Playable"
-
The aim is to avoid reaching for something that will be half-done and broken. Advanced features will be built on top of earlier, complete features.

Simply put, each iteration will always be 'finished', and so, 'playable'.

"Feature"
-
A feature is something that expands what the player can do. It will expand the volume, variety, or possible combinations of interactions that the player can have with the game space.

Let's be practical
-
I've kept the goals above intentionally vague, talking about 'possibility space' and stuff, just so as not to limit myself in the long run. In practice, I'm going to start with a simple idea: a world built of rooms that a player can travel between. Join me next time for version 0001!
